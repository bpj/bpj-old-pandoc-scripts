=head1 BPJ's Pandoc scripts

Some filters and utilities for use with
L<< Pandoc|https://github.com/jgm/pandoc >>, written in Perl. Not all of
them may be useful for other people, but they are here so that I have a
place to grab them. It will generally be evident from the filename, or
at least the documentation, which category they fall into. More scripts
will appear as I write and document them. It was originally my intention
to add only those scripts which I had documented, but I've relaxed that
a bit.

=head2 The scripts

The list below was autogenerated by pulling the first paragraph in the
C<< DESCRIPTION >> section of the Pod documentation of each script, or
if there was no such paragraph inserting a note that the documentation
is still to be written. (This may be inaccurate while I'm still cleaning
up the mess created by my previous attempts at automaticizing the
documentation updating process! There may be some (markdown) documentation
in a comment block at the head of the `scripts/*.pl` files themselves.)

The order is strictly ASCIIbetical, so no discrimination is made
between filters and other scripts. There should also be copies of
the Pod documentation for each script
L<< in the repository wiki|http://git.io/vJXPl >>.
Both the list and the documentation on
the wiki should generally be updated as I make changes.
