# BPJ's Pandoc scripts

Some filters and utilities for use with [Pandoc][], written in Perl. Not all of them may be useful for other people, but they are here so that I have a place to grab them. It will generally be evident from the documentation which category they fall into. More scripts will appear as I write them, *and* document them! :-)

Documentation will be found in the [wiki][].

## The scripts

The list below was autogenerated by snatching bits of the Pod documentation embedded in the scripts at the same time as I converted the Pod to Markdown and put it in the wiki. The order is strictly ASCIIbetical, so no discrimination is made between filters and other scripts. Each entry also has a link to the wiki version of the documentation for that script. Both the list and the documentation on the wiki should generally be updated as I make changes.

### pandoc_texlogo.pl

[Documentation for pandoc_texlogo.pl on the wiki](https://github.com/bpj/bpj-pandoc-scripts/wiki/pandoc_texlogo.pl)

pandoc\_texlogo.pl is a [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
filter to help display the logos for TeX, LaTeX etc. correctly in in
LaTeX (including when generating PDF!) and ConTeXt output
while also rendering them sensibly in other formats.
