This is the documentation for L<< pandoc-base64-img2file.pl|http://git.io/vqdfC >>.

=pod

Pandoc filter which intercepts image elements with data URIs
with Base64 encoded image data, decodes the data and writes
the image to a file with a hopefully correct extension in a
directory designated by the user as a metadata value.

Usage:

    pandoc -F pandoc-base64-img2file.pl \
          [-M image_dir=decoded_images] \
          -f html some.html -t FORMAT -o FILE

image_dir defaults to ./decoded_images

Filenames are on the pattern "decodedImage0000.EXT",
where "0000" is incremented for each data URI encountered
and "EXT" actually is whatever comes after "image/" in the
MIME type of the data URI.

IMPORTANT: You must make sure that there is no whitespace in
the data URIs in the source, and thus that each is all on
one line, or pandoc will become confused.
