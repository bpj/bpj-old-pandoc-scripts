=head1 BPJ's Pandoc scripts

Some filters and utilities for use with
L<< Pandoc|https://github.com/jgm/pandoc >>, written in Perl. Not all of
them may be useful for other people, but they are here so that I have a
place to grab them. It will generally be evident from the filename, or
at least the documentation, which category they fall into. More scripts
will appear as I write and document them. It was originally my intention
to add only those scripts which I had documented, but I've relaxed that
a bit.

=head2 The scripts

The list below was autogenerated by pulling the first paragraph in the
C<< DESCRIPTION >> section of the Pod documentation of each script, or
if there was no such paragraph inserting a note that the documentation
is still to be written. (This may be inaccurate while I'm still cleaning
up the mess created by my previous attempts at automaticizing the
documentation updating process! There may be some (markdown) documentation
in a comment block at the head of the `scripts/*.pl` files themselves.)

The order is strictly ASCIIbetical, so no discrimination is made
between filters and other scripts. There should also be copies of
the Pod documentation for each script
L<< in the repository wiki|http://git.io/vJXPl >>.
Both the list and the documentation on
the wiki should generally be updated as I make changes.

=head3 batch-pandoc.pl

batch-pandoc.pl is a perl script to batch-convert files with a certain
extension in a directory and its descendants with pandoc, creating a
mirror directory structure with converted files.



=head3 pandoc-base64-img2file.pl

Pandoc filter which intercepts image elements with data URIs
with Base64 encoded image data, decodes the data and writes
the image to a file with a hopefully correct extension in a
directory designated by the user as a metadata value,
then replaces the URL in the output document with
the path to that file.



=head3 pandoc-class2latex.pl

Documentation for pandoc-class2latex.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-code2raw.pl

Documentation for pandoc-code2raw.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-dl2ul.pl

No documentation yet!



=head3 pandoc-extract-noattr-div-span.pl

Documentation for pandoc-extract-noattr-div-span.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-keep-div.pl

Documentation for pandoc-keep-div.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-link2span.pl

C<< pandoc-link2span.pl >> is a pandoc filter which overloads link
syntax to define spans.



=head3 pandoc-local-quotes.pl

Documentation for pandoc-local-quotes.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-mintedcode.pl

This is a quick and dirty L<<< I<< pandoc >>|http://pandoc.org >>>
filter which allows you to highlight code in LaTeX output with
L<<< I<< minted >>|https://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted >>> 2.0 rather than
with Pandoc's builtin highlighting mechanism. This is useful because you
get more sophisticated highlighting and formatting of code, and you can
highlight different pieces of code differently, e.g. based on code
language.



=head3 pandoc-no-header-links.pl

Documentation for pandoc-no-header-links.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-no-header-span-ids.pl

Documentation for pandoc-no-header-span-ids.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-number-blocks.pl

Documentation for pandoc-number-blocks.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-plain2email.pl

No documentation yet!



=head3 pandoc-plain2pod.pl

pandoc-plain2pod.pl is a pandoc filter to munge plain output into Perl
POD documentation, a poor man's custom writer implemented as a filter if
you will.



=head3 pandoc-span2cmd.pl

Documentation for pandoc-span2cmd.pl still to be written!

=head3 pandoc-tabularize.pl

C<< pandoc-tabularize.pl >> is a pandoc filter to use the C<< tabular >>
environment instead of the C<< longtable >> package in LaTeX output.
This is especially useful if you want to use C<< twocolumn >> mode,
which doesn't work with C<< longtable >>.



=head3 pandoc-texlogo.pl

pandoc-texlogo.pl is a L<< pandoc|http://pandoc.org/ >> filter to help
display the logos for TeX, LaTeX etc. correctly in in LaTeX (including
when generating PDF!) and ConTeXt output while also rendering them
sensibly in other formats.



=head3 pandoc-zap-images.pl

Documentation for pandoc-zap-images.pl still to be written!
