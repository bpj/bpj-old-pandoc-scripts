**Welcome to the bpj-pandoc-scripts wiki!**

The pages contain documentation for (some of) the scripts in the [`scripts` directory](http://git.io/vLX3n).

The scripts are all written in Perl, and all are related to [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc)
in one way or another.  You may want to read the abstracts in the [README](http://git.io/vqNDt).
